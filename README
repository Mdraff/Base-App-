"first public commit"
Description

This collection contains 100 public marketing commits documenting the digital marketing lifecycle of the Base App on the Base blockchain.
The commits reflect a structured progression from strategy and positioning to growth execution, community building, paid acquisition, PR, and performance analysis.

Each commit represents a concrete marketing action—such as campaign planning, content creation, social media execution, influencer outreach, analytics optimization, and reporting—mirroring how a real Web3 product evolves its marketing efforts over time within the Base ecosystem.

If you want, I can also:

make it sound more technical, investor-focused, or story-driven, or

adapt it for use in a whitepaper, repo README, or launch narrative.
